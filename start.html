  <p>Start your own music tutoring program</p> 
</div>
  
<div class="container">
  <h4>We’re excited to hear you are interested in starting a music tutoring program! We will work with you for every step of the way to get your nonprofit up and running. Here are some details on how the process works.</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 boxes">
      <h3 class="primary_text">Step 1</h3>
      <p>Contact us at info.alto.org@gmail.com and tell us your name and school (or community music group), as well as some background information about your ideas and your community. Once we receive it, you will get the ALTO model template which includes documents, contracts, and sample forms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 boxes">
      <h3 class="primary_text">Step 2</h3>
      <p>We’ll work with you to get your friends, director, school, parent booster organizations, and other members onto the project. This is when we’ll examine how the logistical factors will work in your community.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 boxes">
      <h3 class="primary_text">Step 3</h3>        
	  <p>We’ll work with you to modify the existing model and documents, with help from your director, school, and/or boosters.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 boxes">
      <h3 class="primary_text">Step 4</h3>        
	  <p>With a model and website set, you’ll be ready to begin recruitment for tutors and students. We’ll send you various marketing material templates, and you’ll work with your director and school to get the word out.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 boxes">
      <h3 class="primary_text">Step 5</h3>        
	  <p>After you have some tutors and students, it’ll be time to match them up and begin offering lessons! We will work with you to oversee the process and develop a system for organizing and managing tutors, students, documents, and payments.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 boxes">
      <h3 class="primary_text">Step 6</h3>        
	  <p>As you continue to run your program, we will check in with you on a regular basis to see how things are going. We will help you with any conflicts that arise and with modifying the program when necessary.</p>
