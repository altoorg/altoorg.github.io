  <p>Start your own music tutoring program</p> 
</div>
  
<div class="container">
  <h4>We’re excited to hear you are interested in starting a music tutoring program! We will work with you for every step of the way to get your nonprofit up and running. Here are some details on how the process works.</h4>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 boxes">
      <h3 class="primary_text">Step 1</h3>
	  <p>Fill out the form of interest, linked <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1k5zVk6dUHUg6mci9YBuzeQbN6Bew8uyersLm3IyaPpg">Here</a></b>. Once we receive it, you’ll receive the ALTO model template which includes program description, documents, outlines, and sample documents. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 boxes">
      <h3 class="primary_text">Step 2</h3>
	  <p>Get your friends, director, school, parent booster organizations, and other members interested in the project. This is when we’ll help you examine how the logistical factors will work in your community and ways of modifying the model to fit the needs of your school and community. This includes developing a system for managing tutors, assigning tutors to students, and collecting/sending documents and payments. This will require help from both your director and parent boosters and/or school.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 boxes">
      <h3 class="primary_text">Step 3</h3>        
	  <p>Once the model has been modified and a website has been created, you’ll be ready to begin recruiting tutors, finding students, matching tutors to students, and begin offering lessons! Your director will help you get the word out in your community, and we’ll help you with any issues you run into during the process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6 boxes">
      <h3 class="primary_text">Step 4</h3>        
	  <p>As you continue to run your program, we will check in with you to see how things are going and help fix issues that arise.</p>
