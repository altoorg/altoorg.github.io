	<h3 class="primary_text">About Alto</h3>
    <p>The mission of the American League of Tutoring Organizations (ALTO), a national youth-run nonprofit based in California, is to work with local high school musicians to start music tutoring programs in their school or community by providing the ALTO music tutoring program model, template documents, resources, step-by-step guidance, and consulting. Our affiliated tutoring programs in each community are independent music tutoring programs which are based on the ALTO music tutoring program model but then are modified to fit the needs of each community. The mission of each affiliated program varies, but our goal as a league is to provide affordable, high quality music lessons to as many students as possible around the country. As our name suggests, we work to help build music tutoring programs across the United States, however we do work with communities abroad.

	<h3 class="primary_text">About ALTO’s Music Tutoring Program Model</h3>
	<p>ALTO’s model is a template for music tutoring programs which can be modified and adjusted to fit the needs of each school and community. Our program is designed so that at least one Coordinator, a high school musician, is in charge of running the program with assistance from their music director, school, and/or parent booster organization. The Coordinator is in charge of matching tutors and students, collecting payments and lesson records, managing tutors, hosting tutor meetings, marketing, and working with their music director. Programs can also have multiple Coordinators to divide up the roles. Each tutor goes through an application process, is trained for tutoring, and keeps a lesson record to log hours of work and note progress.</p>

	<p>Many variations are possible using ALTO’s model. The standard program is a reduced price music tutoring program which is run by a high school coordinator(s), where 100% of the payments from parents go to pay the tutors. On the other hand, some affiliated programs will offer free lessons, where tutors are volunteers and there is no monetary transaction within the program. Programs can also offer both, where most tutors work for pay while volunteer tutors hold free lessons to students in need of financial aid. The model’s versatility allows it to work for many types of music programs, including band, orchestra, choir, and keyboard groups. Because each school has different organizational structures for their music departments, we offer three tutoring program submodels depending on each type of school. The three submodels are the Director-Booster submodel, Director-District submodel, and the Independent submodel.</p>

	<p>Due to the pandemic, ALTO’s model will be provided as an online-only format. This means lessons will be on video conferencing platforms, tutor meetings will be virtual, and all communication between the tutors, Coordinator, director, school, and/or Boosters will be online. However, on an operational level there are no differences between ALTO’s in-person and online models; the only change is that the medium of communication is online.</p>

	<p>ALTO’s Team will assist you every step of the way to build the ideal music tutoring program for your school and community. This includes helping you with modifying the tutoring program model to fit your community and working with music directors, boosters, and the school district. Once the program is up and running, we will continue to offer support and consultation.</p>
	<h3 class="primary_text">Our History</h3>
	<p>ALTO’s model is based on the Davis High School Strings Tutoring Program, founded in fall of 2019 and based in Davis, CA. The program was developed by Kai Keltner and his orchestra director, Angelo Moreno, with the mission of motivating Elementary and Junior High School students to enjoy playing and practicing their instrument. High school tutors from the Davis High School Orchestras run lessons in the same fashion as private music teachers, charging $15 per hour. Even with the sudden shift to online Zoom lessons due to the pandemic, the program enjoyed great success, with almost 100 participants over the course of the 2019-20 school year. The versatility and replicability of our model inspired us to assist other communities and our school’s band program to build models similar to ours, with the mission of giving the opportunity for reduced price music lessons to as many students as possible.</p>
